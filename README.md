## Task 1 - Equation of State (EOS) Fitting

[(Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch–Murnaghan_equation_of_state) The Birch–Murnaghan isothermal equation of state, published in 1947 by Albert Francis Birch of Harvard, is a relationship between the volume of a body and the pressure to which it is subjected. The third-order Birch–Murnaghan isothermal equation of state is given by the following equation: 

$$P(V) = \frac{3B_0}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^{7/3} - \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^{5/3} \right] \left[ 1 + \frac{3}{4} \left( B_0' - 4 \right) \left( \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^{2/3} - 1 \right) \right]$$ 

The internal energy, E(V), is found by integration of the pressure: 

$$E(V) = \int P(V) dV$$

The Birch–Murnaghan equation of state is then given by:

$$E(V) = E_0 + \frac{9B_0V_0}{16} \left[ \left[ \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^{2/3} - 1 \right]^3 B_0' + \left[ \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^{2/3} - 1 \right]^2 \left[ 6 - 4 \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^{2/3} \right] \right]$$ 

where $E_0$ is the internal energy at the reference volume $V_0$ and $B_0$ and $B_0'$ are the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative at $V_0$, respectively. The equilibrium volume $V_0$ is found by minimizing the energy with respect to $V$. 

In this problem, we will use the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state to calculate the equilibrium volume of a crystal. The input file, eos.csv, contains Volume (A^3/atom) and Energy (eV/atom) data for a crystal at various volumes. To simplify the problem, we will use the following equation for the EOS fitting: 

$$E(V) = a + bV^{-2/3} + cV^{-4/3} + dV^{-6/3}$$ 

where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are fitting parameters. Please write a program to read the data from eos.csv and fit the data to the above equation. The program should print the fitting parameters and the equilibrium volume. Please use the following Python libraries: numpy, pandas, and scipy.optimize.

## Task 2 - Visualizing Your Results

Based on the results from Task 1, please plot the energy as a function of volume. Please use the following Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy.optimize, and matplotlib.

## Task 3 - Using GitHub to Share Your Code

Please create a GitHub repository and upload your code for Task 1 and Task 2. Please include a README.md file that includes a brief description of your code.
